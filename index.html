                Our affinity diagram breaks down our proposed solutions to this problem into a few classes.
                We recognize that there are many avenues of development for this problem, both technical and
                social, for implementation. We've put our ideas down and broken them down into categores of
                technical details, plans to get the school on board, ideas for expansion to other problems as well,
                cost and pricing management, and Ideas to avoid cheating and assure accountability from the Students
                with this service.

                Charles Christopher White Jr.: "I wish I wasn't so broke all the time. My parents disowned me as soon as I turned 18 for being a furry, so paying for college is hard. Paying for an Iclicker or Top Hat certainly doesn't help!"
