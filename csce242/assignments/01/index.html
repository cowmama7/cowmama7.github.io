        <h1>The Emerson TrainDex</h1>
        <p>The TrainDex is a place for me to organize all of the trains<br>
            I've ever been on in my life. As a train aficionado, I take pride<br>
            in the number of trains I've been on. Below you will find a table with<br>
            images of the respective trains, as well as links to their wikipedia pages.<br>
            You can find a lot more information about these trains on their respective<br>
            wikipedia pages.<br><br>
            I've been on trains in both the USA, as well as Europe. I've rode them for function <br>
            as well as for fun! My personal favorite trains to ride are the Amtrak Silver service <br>
            trains, with the viewliner rolling stock, as they're the most comfortable trains I've been on. <br>
            My favorite locomotives are the new Siemens Charger locomotives that have just started service <br>
            on several amtrak routes. <br>
