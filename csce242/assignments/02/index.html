                 The railway is often seen as obsolete, unneccessary engineering. That is simply untrue. <br>
            Railways are purpose built for moving large quantities of objects, including people. <br>
            Many companies have spent billions of dollars on improving self-driving, and self-guiding <br>
            car technology, when railways have had that down for ages. A single freight train can move the <br>
            same amount of goods as over 500 semi-trucks, and with far greater fuel efficiency. <br><br>
                It seems, at least in America, that the government is bent on sacrificing this <br>
            superior engineering, in favor of roadways. This is likely because the motor companies are able <br>
            to lobby much harder for federal support, as they are able to take much larger profits from individuals. <br>
            additionally, motor compaies do not need to support the development and maintenence of the country's <br>
            roadways, which is an expectation from nearly railway companies. This double standard is what is crushing <br>
            our country's railways.
